                              <h2>About me</h2>
                              <p><strong>Hi, I'm Junan, a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University. I greatly appreciate your time for coming to this page and learning more about me! I'm seeking for SDE internship for summer 2023. Here are some of my interest and technical background.</strong></p>
                              
                              <p><strong>During my four years of undergraduate study in China, I majored in Intelligent science and technology, except basic data structures and algorithms, databases and programming languages like C++ and python, I mainly focused on machine learning, deep learning, data science and big data, that's why you see there are so many related articles about artificial intelligence things in my blog.</strong></p>
                             
                              <p><strong>While blogging is just a small part of my previous studies and work.  
                                   In my part time, competition and internship experience, I developed a mobile app to operate the movements of a dancing robot, deployed C programs to control the steering of a smart car,  and reconstructed the crawler platform of my internship team. I really found my interest in software engineering like web development and mobile development, I enjoy the process of building my project step by step, I was deeply attracted by how it's working and all the amazing work it could do. So I applied for related graduate programs after I graduate from college, hoping to have further study in software development skills. Luckily I got almost all offers from the schools I applied to, which also gave me a lot of courage to stick to my interest and choice.</strong></p>
       
                              <p><strong>Now I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in MSMITE (Mobile and Internet of Things Engineering) program beginning in Jan 2023 and I will graduate in May 2024. One of my registered courses in the first semester is principles of software construction, I plan to enhance my understanding of object-oriented programming in Java, and other very helpful skills in work like Git for version control, design pattern, unit test, concurrency and so on. Another course I registered for is Mobile and Not Computing Services, I will learn to evaluate critical design tradeoffs associated with different mobile technologies, architectures, interfaces and how they impact the usability, security, privacy and commercial viability of mobile and pervasive computing services and apps. </strong></p>
                         
                              <p><strong>I really hope to apply general computer science technology to real-world problems using real-world tools and technics. So after I finish the courses in the first semester, I plan to take an internship in the summer and apply what I learned from school. I am very good at working in a team environment since I have two internship experiences, I will always be a good communicator 
                                   to have better cooperate with team members. My available summer intern time is May 15th - Aug 25th in 2023. I will cherish every opportunity I get and finally devote myself to my choice.</strong></p>

                              <p><strong>All of my basic technical and interest backgrounds are as above, hoping that my sincerity will be expressed appropriately. Feel free to contact me for any opportunity (or maybe you just need a Chinese friend to hang out with or even a mandarin tutor ðŸ˜Š) that's all fine!</strong></p>
